# TicketBox
A mock ticket purchase website

This is my first project I've created using a frontend framework called Vue.js. This website is supposed to be similar to other websites that you would purchase tickets from. Using compute functions in Vue.js, I made it so new information renders on the page as you fill out the name fields and ticket information.
